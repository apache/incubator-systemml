# THIS SCRIPT COMPUTES A SOLUTION FOR THE STABLE MARRIAGE PROBLEM

# INPUT PARAMETERS:

# NAME                  TYPE       DEFAULT      MEANING
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# P                     Matrix     ---          proposer matrix P.
#                                               It must be a square matrix with no zeros.
#
# A                     Matrix     ---          acceptor matrix A.
#                                               It must be a square matrix with no zeros.
#
# ordered               Boolean    TRUE         If true, P and A are assumed to be ordered,
#                                               i.e. the leftmost value in a row is the most preferred partner's index.
#                                               i.e. the leftmost value in a row in P is the preference value for the acceptor with index 1 and vice-versa (higher is better).

#                                               Further, if cell [i,j] is non-zero, it holds the preference value that led to the match.
