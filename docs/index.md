SystemML is a flexible, scalable machine learning (ML) system.
SystemML's distinguishing characteristics are: (1) algorithm customizability,
(2) multiple execution modes, including Standalone, Hadoop Batch, and Spark Batch,
and (3) automatic optimization.

SystemML is now an **Apache Incubator** project! Please see the [**Apache SystemML (incubating)**](http://systemml.apache.org/)
website for more information.
